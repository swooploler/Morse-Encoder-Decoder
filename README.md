# Morse-Encoder-Decoder
// morse-decode-encode
//
// Either Key in a Morse code sequence using the button to decode,
// or click in the field in the Serial Monitor, and
// type letters followed by Enter to encode into Morse code.
// The LED and tone will sound while you key in the sequence.
// This sketch decodes sequences with letters or numbers
// and prints them to the serial monitor.
// A beep sounds and "?" prints for unrecognized sequences.
//
// To learn Morse Code, type a word in the Serial Monitor,
// Then try keying in the same word as you heard it.
// Tips: 
//   Keep dots short, and dashes long. 
//   Leave a short space after letters.
//   Leave a longer space after words.
//   Try to make nice clean presses and releases.
//
// Circuit:
// Piezo buzzer or speaker connects to pin 2 and ground
// Button connects between pin 8 and ground
// LED (+) to pin 13, (-) 220 Ohm resistor to ground
